# Stocks Analysis - Challenge 2

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project was to help Steve analyze his stocks performance over that past few years 2017 and 2018. Our analysis shows the total daily volume as well as the % return over the year for each individual stock and easily highlights the underperformers vs the performers.

## Results

### The results of this analysis is that in 2017 Steve's stocks overall performed better than in 2018. Per the tables below you can see more positive returns in 2017 than in 2018. Which is easily depicted in the green highlighted cells.

What you'll also notice in the above tables is that the time it took to run the 2018 data was faster than the run time for 2017. This may be because we ran the analysis on 2017 first before 2018 and run time performs faster the more times it is run, since the data has already been analyzed once before.

## Summary

### In summary there are both advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code. In general, **advantages** may be that we help improve the current code by combining ideas and different methods on how to write the code better. This may also include adding commentary making the code more easily readible. Some **disadvantages** may be the code may take some time to comprehend given someone else may have written the code and their logic or thought process might be different than how you would have written code. Trying to refactor someone elses code may be difficult at times because methods are differing.

### These pros and cons apply to my refactoring of the original VBA script by:

- *Pro:* I was able to improve the code resulting in a faster run time. The original **All Stocks Analysis** code ran the analysis over 1 second, the refactored code runs the analysis in less than a second by ~0.3 seconds. 
- *Con:* The disadvantage that I noticed is that it took me some time for me to understand the code that was already written and in addition figure out the design pattern for the new code to implement ensuring it is consistent with the current design pattern.
